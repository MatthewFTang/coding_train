## Overview

This project showcases a collection of creative coding examples, including:

-   **Ripple Simulation**: A 2D water ripple effect inspired by Hugo Elias' methods and Coding Train's Challenge #102.
-   **Game of Life**: A simulation of Conway's Game of Life inspired by Coding Train's Challenge #85.
-   **Cube Wave**: A 3D wave animation using cubes.
-   **Avalanche Simulation**: A physics-based simulation inspired by Coding Train's Challenge #3.

Each example is implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with libraries like `p5.js` and `matter.js` where applicable.
